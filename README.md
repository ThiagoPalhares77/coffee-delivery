# Coffee Delivery Project

Project developed to solve the challenge of the ignite course. I chose to use Next.js, TailwindCSS, and React-hook-form as some of the frameworks.

## Overview

The project simulates a coffee sales website, where the cart is made using React's context technology. It has an address form and payment method using React-hook-form. It ends with an order confirmation page.

## Main Project Technologies

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- React-hook-form
